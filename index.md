**Last updated:** October 31, 2025

Matrodev ("we," "us," or "our") built the Parking Reminder app as an Ad-Supported app. This app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use our app.

## Summary

Our app is designed to be simple and respect your privacy:
* We **do not** collect or store any of your personal information on our servers.
* Your parking location is saved **only on your device**.
* We **do not** share your location with anyone.
* The app uses Google AdMob, which does collect data to serve ads.

### 1. Information Collection and Use

Parking Reminder has one primary function: to save your parked car's location.

To do this, the app requires the **Precise Location (GPS)** permission (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`). 

This location information (latitude and longitude) is collected **only** when you press the "Save" button. This information, along with a timestamp, is stored **locally on your device** using Jetpack DataStore.

This information is **never** transmitted to us or any third party by us.

### 2. Information Deletion

You have full control over your data. You can permanently delete your saved location data at any time by pressing the "Delete Parking" button within the app.

### 3. Third-Party Services

The app uses third-party services that may collect information.

* **Google AdMob:** The app is monetized using Google AdMob. AdMob is a third-party service from Google that may collect its own data to serve personalized ads. We recommend you review [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
* **Google Maps (Intent):** When you tap "Retrieve Location," the app does not use your location. It sends the *saved* coordinates to Google Maps (or another mapping app) via an Intent to request navigation. Your interaction with Google Maps is covered by their own privacy policy.

### 4. Log Data

We do not collect any log data or analytics.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
