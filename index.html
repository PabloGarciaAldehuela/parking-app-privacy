    <h1>Privacy Policy for Parking Reminder</h1>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 31, 2025</p>

    <p>Matrodev ("we," "us," or "our") built the Parking Reminder app as an Ad-Supported app. This app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

    <p>This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use our app.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Our app is designed to be simple and respect your privacy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We <strong>do not</strong> collect or store any of your personal information on our servers.</li>
        <li>Your parking location is saved <strong>only on your device</strong>.</li>
        <li>We <strong>do not</strong> share your location with anyone.</li>
        <li>The app uses Google AdMob, which does collect data to serve ads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Parking Reminder has one primary function: to save your parked car's location.</p>
    <p>To do this, the app requires the <strong>Precise Location (GPS)</strong> permission (<code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code>).</p>
    <p>This location information (latitude and longitude) is collected <strong>only</strong> when you press the "Save" button. This information, along with a timestamp, is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Jetpack DataStore.</p>
    <p>This information is <strong>never</strong> transmitted to us or any third party by us.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data. You can permanently delete your saved location data at any time by pressing the "Delete Parking" button within the app.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses third-party services that may collect information.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> The app is monetized using Google AdMob. AdMob is a third-party service from Google that may collect its own data to serve personalized ads. We recommend you review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Maps (Intent):</strong> When you tap "Retrieve Location," the app does not use your location. It sends the <em>saved</em> coordinates to Google Maps (or another mapping app) via an Intent to request navigation. Your interaction with Google Maps is covered by their own privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Log Data</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any log data or analytics.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at:</p>
